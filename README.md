# Custom Edit Link 

The 'Update Edit Link' dialog will appear when the author removes an item that is linked to another item. This code will hide anything coming from the layout or final layout, meaning any component that has a reference in the datasource from presentation details will not be shown in the list. However, other link items, such as a General Link field or a link from the rich text editor, will be displayed.
